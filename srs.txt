Library Management System (LMS) - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed description of the functional and non-functional requirements for the College Library Management System (LMS). It is intended for the development team, project stakeholders, and college administration to serve as a definitive guide for what the system will accomplish.
1.2 Scope
The LMS is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to automate the entire suite of library operations, replacing an inefficient manual system. It will manage books, members, and transactions, while providing distinct, role-based interfaces for librarians and students. The system aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and user accessibility.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
•	LMS: Library Management System.
•	Admin/Librarian: The primary user with full system access for all management tasks.
•	Student: A library member who can borrow books and use the self-service portal.
•	Accession Number: A unique identifier for each book copy, designed to be compatible with barcode labels.
•	Batch Number: A unique identifier for each student (Eg: AC-078CSIT34)
•	Transaction: A record of a book issue, return event.
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The LMS will be a new, self-contained web application. It will integrate with the existing college portal for student authentication to provide a seamless login experience. The system will be developed on a MySQL/PHP.
2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
•	Administrator/Librarian: This user is responsible for all data management. The system must be intuitive and efficient for them, as they are not expected to be highly technical. 
•	Student: This user accesses the system to view their account and search for books. The interface must be simple and clear, providing easy access to their personal borrowing information (like: currently holding books, history) through their existing college login.
2.3 Operating Environment
•	Software: The system will operate on a server running a Windows OS with XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP). It will be accessible through modern web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
•	Hardware: Standard desktop computers for library staff and barcode scanners for efficient book and student ID processing.
2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
•	The application shall be developed using the PHP programming language, preferably with the Laravel framework, and use MySQL for the database.
•	The user interface shall be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework to ensure a responsive design.
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
•	It is assumed that the college will provide server infrastructure for hosting the application.
•	The project depends on the availability of student data (e.g., Batch Number, name, email) from the college's central system for authentication and profile setup.
3. System Features and Functional Requirements
Admin Portal:
3.1 Book Management
The system shall:
•	Allow an Administrator to add new book records, including Title, Author, ISBN, Accession Number, and Status.
•	Allow an Administrator to edit the details of any existing book record.
•	Allow an Administrator to delete a book record from the system.
•	Allow all users to search the book catalog by Title, Author, or Accession Number.
•	Display the full details and current status (Available/Issued) for any book.
•	Maintain and display a complete history of all issue and return transactions for each book.
3.2 Student Management
The system shall:
•	Allow an Administrator to search for a student by Name or by scanning a Student ID.
•	Display a detailed student profile containing:
o	Personal details.
o	List of currently issued books.
o	History of returned books.
o	Total outstanding fines.
•	Automatically calculate and display the time remaining in a student's 6-month validity period.

3.3 Transaction Processing
The system shall:
•	Allow an Administrator to issue a book by scanning a Student ID and a Book Barcode, creating a transaction and updating the book's status.
•	Allow an Administrator to return a book by scanning the Book Barcode, automatically updating the book's status to "Available".
•	Automatically calculate a fine of Rs. 2 per day if a book is returned after its due date.
•	Allow an Administrator to view logs of all reserved books and the student who reserved it and allow operations such as: Accept or Delete the reservation of book.
3.4 Student Portal
The system shall:
•	Allow students to log in using their college portal credentials.
•	Allow students to view their personal profile and currently issued books with due dates.
•	Allow students to check their current fine amount.
•	Allow students to view their complete borrowing history.
•	Allow students to search the available book catalog by Title or Author.

3.5 Reservations
The system shall:
•	Allow a student to reserve a book for 24 hours when it is available, preventing others from reserving it within that window.
•	Auto-expire pending reservations after 24 hours; expired reservations are not eligible for issue.
•	Allow a student to cancel their own pending reservation.
•	Allow an Administrator to view, issue from, decline, or remove reservations.
•	Enforce that only the reserving student can issue the reserved book during the active reservation window.

3.6 Dashboard & Reporting
The system shall:
•	Provide an Administrator dashboard with counts of total books, total members, active loans, and overdue items.
•	Surface per-book issuance state and accrued fine estimate during searches.

3.7 Authentication & Authorization
The system shall:
•	Provide an Administrator login using credentials configured by the institution (initial implementation uses server-configured credentials).
•	Provide a Student login via email and Batch Number, maintaining session state to access the student portal.
•	Protect Administrator routes with admin-only middleware and Student routes with student-only middleware.

3.8 Student and Book Search & Scanning Support
The system shall:
•	Support searching books by Accession Number (with numeric-only normalization) or by partial Title.
•	Support searching students by Batch Number (scanned values normalized) or by exact match.
•	Support barcode scanners for Accession Number and Student ID input via standard keyboard wedge devices.

4. External Interface Requirements
4.1 User Interfaces
The system shall feature a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface that works effectively on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. The Administrator interface will be dashboard-driven allowing to perform major CRUD operations, while the student portal will be simplified and focused on self-service tasks.
4.2 Hardware Interfaces
The system must support interaction with standard USB barcode scanners for efficient data entry.
4.3 Software Interfaces
